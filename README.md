I wrote here some code of HTML using vs code IDE which is the basic front-end structure of a website at a beginner level. I explored many tags, attributes, elements eg. forms,
img, href etc. to give a basic look for this work eventually. I will definitely work in this project as a practice session to improve my skills and potentially of web 
development. For further discussion, feel free to contact me!
